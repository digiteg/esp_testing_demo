# Test fixture:Â test fixture is the fixed state of the objects used as the source when performing tests.
# The purpose of using fixture is if you have a complex test case, then preparing the desired state can easily take a lot of resources 
# (for example, you consider a function with certain accuracy and each next sign of accuracy in the calculations takes a day). 
# Using fixture (on slang - fixtures), we skip the preliminary preparation of the state and immediately begin testing. 
# Test fixture can appear, for example, in the form (database state, set of environment variables, set of files with the necessary content).

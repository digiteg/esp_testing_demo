# **ESP8266 Simple Testing with examples in Micropython**

I was digging on internet for some examples about testing on ESP8266 in MicroPython just for myself education purpose and I didn't find too much useful examples for me. So I decided to fill this gap and I hope this can be  also useful for others who are willing to deal with the topic or teach their students about basics and how to automate testing. Why ESP8266 ? Because it is cost-effective and highly integrated Wi-Fi MCU for IoT / smart things... applications

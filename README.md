# **ESP8266 Simple Testing with examples in Micropython**

I was digging on internet for some examples about testing on ESP8266 in Micropython just for myself education purpose and I didn't find too much useful examples for me. So I decided to fill this gap and I hope this can be  also useful for others who are willing to deal with the topic or teach their students about basics and how to automate testing. Why ESP8266 ? Because it is cost-effective and highly integrated Wi-Fi MCU for IoT / smart things... applications

# Long story short

## **Back to Testing..**

You can find lot of great articles about this topic explaining why it is worth spend so much time with Testing or why TDD make sense and so on. Usually my first and simple answer why is ist just because we want to suppress future costs of fixing bugs in production. Real nightmare of each developer doing coding for living should be spending hours of life time in finding bugs in code done by someone else running production with help of neurotic manager who is keeping him or her in pace..  
 
Some summary from my small internet research is bellow and it is about what could be considered and make sense in our case if we develop IoT application with ESP8266 and Micropython

### **Best practices for effective IoT Testing**

- Gray Box testing as it allows to design effective test case
- Gray Box allows you to know the OS, the architecture, third-party hardware, new connectivity and hardware device limitation.
- Real Time Operating System
- IoT Testing should be automated


### **Challenges of IOT Testing**
- Network and internal communication
- Security
- The system complexity & bugs present in the IOT technology
- Limitations in memory, processing power, bandwidth, battery life, etc.

# PRINCIPLES OF TESTING

There are many different types of testing that you can use to make sure that changes to your code are working as expected.
At a high level, Manual testing is done in person, for example by pushing buttons observing LEDs or interacting with APIs etc. Automated tests, are performed by a machine that executes a test script that has been written for our case in MicroPython.

![Types of Testing](/img/typestesting.png)

#### White Box testing
White-box testing is a testing technique which checks the internal functioning of the system. The white-box Testing method assumes that the Tester knows the code logic in a unit or program etc.

#### Black Box testing
Black-box testing, a tester doesn't have any information about the internal working of an application. Black box testing is a high level of testing that focuses on the behavior and involves testing from an external or end-user perspective. Black box testing can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system, and acceptance...



#### Functional tests
Functional testing is a type of testing which verifies that each function of an application operates in conformance with the requirement specification. They only verify the output of an action and do not check the intermediate states of the system when performing that action.

#### Unit tests
Unit tests are very low level. They consist in testing individual methods of the classes and functions and are in general quite cheap to automate and can be run very quickly in continuous integration scenarios.

#### Integration tests
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used in your application work well together. 

#### Non-Functional tests
Non-functional testing is a type of testing to check non-functional aspects (compatibility, performance, usability,  etc.) of an application. It is explicitly designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing.

# Getting Started with first level - Unit Tests are just functions


- **Unit tests** are typically made of three pieces, some **setup**, a number of **assertions**, and some **tear-down**. 

- **Setup** can be as simple as initializing the input values or as complex as creating and initializing concrete instances of a class. 

- **Execution**, the test occurs when an assertion is made, comparing the observed and expected values. For example, let us test  that our mean function successfully calculates the known value for a simple list.

Try to copy and paste following code examples into REPL

### Step 1: MicroPython hello _**assert**_ Keyword

The assert keyword is usually used when we debugging or and lets you test if a condition in your code returns *True*, if not, the program will raise an *AssertionError*.
You can also add a message to be written if the code returns False, check the examples below.

```python
x = "hello Micropython"
    
#if condition returns True, then nothing happens:
assert x == "hello Micropython"
    
#if condition returns False, AssertionError is raised:
assert x == "bye"
```
### Step 2:  Add message

Write a message if the condition is False

```python
x = "hello Micropython"

#if condition returns False, AssertionError is raised:

assert x == "bye", "x should be 'hello Micropython'"
```
### Step 3: Handle *AssertionError* exceptions with  _**try**_ / _**except**_ / _**finally**_ block

In example the try block raises an *AssertionError* and the except block will be executed. Without the try block, program will crash and raise an error

```python
# try/except/finally example

try:
    assert "Hello" == "Hello"
    assert 3 == 2, "Failed"
    print("Test try/except/finally : pass")

except AssertionError as err:
    print("Test try/except/finally Assertion error: {0}".format(err))
except:
    print("An unexpected exception occurred")
finally:
    print("Teardown try/except/finally...")
```

### Step 4:

```python
# Array Test:

test_list1 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
test_list2 = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]

assert test_list1 == test_list2
print("Array test : pass")
```
### Step 5:

```python
# Tuple Test:

test_tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
test_tuple2 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

assert test_tuple1 == test_tuple2
print("Tuple test : pass")
```
### Step 6:

```python
# Set test

test_set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
test_set2 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

assert test_set1 == test_set2
print("Set test: pass")
```
### Step 7:

```python
# Dictionary test:

test_dict1 = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}

test_dict2 = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}

assert test_dict1 == test_dict2
print("Dictionary test: pass")
```

# Testing Techniques 

## 1. Equivalence Partitioning
![Equivalence Partitioning](/img/testtecheqp.png)


```python
# Equivalence Partitioning

age = 18  # entered age

"""
age = 5
age = 17
age = 18
age = 30
age = 59
age = 61

age = -1
age = 0
age = None
"""


assert age >= 18 and age <= 60, "Equivalence Partitioning test Fail: <=17 Invalid, 18-60 valid, >=61 Invalid"
print("Equivalence Partitioning test: pass")
```

## 2. Boundary Value Analysis
![Boundary Value Analysis](/img/testtechbva.png)


```python
# Boundary Value Analysis


def validateAge(age):
    return (age >= 18) and (age <= 60)


def testBVA():
    age_min = 17
    age_max = 60

    min_0 = age_min - 1
    min_1 = age_min + 1
    min_m = age_min + age_max / 2
    max_1 = age_max
    max_2 = age_max + 1

    def inner(age):
        assert validateAge(
            age), "Boundary Value Analysis test Fail: <=17 Invalid, 18-60 valid, >=61 Invalid"

    inner(18)

#    inner(min_0)
#    inner(min_1)
#    inner(min_m)
#    inner(max_1)
#    inner(max_2)

    print("Boundary Value Analysis test: pass")


testBVA()
```

## 3. Decision Table Testing

Following example covers 3 clearly distinguished printer issues with how to fix them actions translated into **Decision table**

### **Printer issues - Decision Table / Cause-Effect**
|Conditions|Rule 1|Rule 2|Rule 3|Rule 4|Rule 5|Rule 6| Rule 7|
| :----------------|---:|---:| ----:| ----:| ----:|----:|----:|
| Printer does not print | True	 | True | False | False | True | True | False
| A red light is flashing | False | True | True | False | True| False| True
| Printer is unrecognized | True | True | True | True | False| False| False
| **Actions** 	 
| Check the power cable | x	| 
| Check the printer-computer cable | x | x | 
| Ensure printer software is installed | x | x | x |x |
| Check/replace ink | | x |x | |x ||x|
| Check for paper jam | | | | | x |x|


```python
# Decision Table translated into MicroPython with test

# Conditions for printer issue description
conditions = ["Printer does not print", "A red light is flashing",
              "Printer is unrecognized"]  # That was 3 conditions

# Actions
Power_Cable = "Check the power cable"
Printer_Computer_Cable = "Check the printer-computer cable"
Software_Installed = "Ensure printer software is installed"
New_Ink = "Check/replace ink"
Paper_Jam = "Check for paper jam"

# Rule Set building 
rules = [((True,  False, True),  Power_Cable),
         ((True,  True,  True),  Printer_Computer_Cable),
         ((True,  False, True),  Printer_Computer_Cable),
         ((True,  True,  True),  Software_Installed),
         ((True,  False, True),  Software_Installed),
         ((False, True,  True),  Software_Installed),
         ((False, False, True),  Software_Installed),
         ((True,  True,  True),  New_Ink),
         ((True,  True,  False), New_Ink),
         ((False, True,  True),  New_Ink),
         ((False, True,  False), New_Ink),
         ((True,  True,  False), Paper_Jam),
         ((True,  False, False), Paper_Jam)
         ]

# Exec rules evaluation
def evalRule(tupl, table):
    answ = []
    for key, val in table:
        if key == tupl:
            answ.append(val)
    return answ

# test DTT
def testDTT():
    
    testcond = (False,  True, True)

    print(conditions[0], ' = ' ,testcond[0])
    print(conditions[1], ' = ' ,testcond[1])
    print(conditions[2], ' = ' ,testcond[2])

    answ = evalRule(testcond, rules) 
    print(answ)
    
    assert answ[0] == Software_Installed and answ[1]== New_Ink and len(answ)<3, "Decision Table test Fail: expected answer =" + Power_Cable
    
    print("Decision Table test: pass")

testDTT()
```

## 4. State Transition Testing
![State Transition Testing](/img/testtechstt.png)

## 5. Error Guessing
Tester knows common mistakes that developers usually forget to handle:
- Divide by zero.
- Handling null values in text fields.
- Accepting the Submit button without any value.
- File upload without attachment.
- File upload with less than or more than the limit size.

## 6. Graph-Based Testing Methods
- Each and every application is a build-up of some objects. 
- All such objects are identified and the graph is prepared. 
- From this object graph, each object relationship is identified and test cases are written accordingly to discover the errors.

## 7. Comparison Testing
- Different independent versions of the same software are used to compare to each other for testing in this method.



# Application of Testing Techniques 

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1 [wikipedia]

```python
# returns fibonacci number
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) # recursive call 
```

![State Transition Testing](/img/fib.jpg)

Lets try few testing techniques applied on fibonacci function example
- Boundary Values
- Error Guessing
```python
# Fibonacci

def fib(n):
    
#    if n is None or type(n) is str or n < 0:
#        return 0
    
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


try:
    assert fib(0) == 0  # test edge 0
    assert fib(1) == 1   # test edge 1
    assert fib(8) == 21  # test internal point expected 21

    assert fib(-1) == 0, "invalid value -1"  # test invalid value
    assert fib(None) == 0, "invalid value None"  # test null value
    assert fib('a') == 0, "invalid value 'a'"  # test wrong value type


    print("Fibonacci test: pass")

except AssertionError as err:
    print("Fibonacci test Fail: {0}".format(err))
#except:
#    print("Fibonacci test Fail:An unexpected exception occurred")
```

# Integration Test - Example

"""
Integration tests are the class of tests that verify that multiple moving pieces and gears inside the clock work well together. 
Where unit tests investigate the gears, integration tests look at the position of the hands to determine if the clock can tell time correctly. 
They look at the system as a whole or at its subsystems. Integration tests typically function at a higher level conceptually than unit tests. 
Thus, writing integration tests also happens at a higher level.
